## Generate-Yo-Plate!
## Welcome! 

### USER STORY
AS I am cooking
I CAN search for an ingredient
WHEN searched recipes are generated if the ingredient is true
WHEN I select a recipe, a window appears
WHEN a window opens, the directions appear 
THERE is a text-to-speech api that reads the directions
THERE is also a spotify playlist that plays jazz

## Mission Statement
To ease the chore of cooking. 
You can search for an ingredient, and decide on a variety of meals based on that ingredient.
You also have the ability to have the directions read to you by the click of a button.
Lastly, if you're feeling groovy, you can play Spotify through the link that was been embedded.

## Future Development
Future development includes:

    - listing the ingredients
    - a calorie counter
    - search by multiple ingredients
    - ingredient filtering
    - updating the voice
