### USER STORY
AS I am cooking
I CAN search for an ingredient
WHEN searched recipes are generated if the ingredient is true
WHEN I select a recipe, a window appears
WHEN a window opens, the directions appear 
THERE is a text-to-speech api that reads the directions
THERE is also a spotify playlist that plays jazz


NOTE: THIS IS ONLY AN EXAMPLE ON HOW TO ADD IMAGES TO README FILES, PICTURE IS OF CURRENT STATE

I COPIED AND PASTED THIS PICTURE INTO THE GITHUB README
THEN I CUT IT FROM THE GITHUB README 
THEN I PASTED IT INTO VS TO GENERATE THE URL
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE READ ME IN GITHUB THE PICTURE NOW APPEARS
